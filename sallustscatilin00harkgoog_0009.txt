PREFAGE.

 

Tms edition of Sallust’s Work on the conspiracy of
Catiline has been prepared expressly for school use.
As a part of a regular course of Latin study, it is in-
tended to follow Gaesar's Commentaries on the Gallio
war, but to precede the Oratione of Cicero.

In the preparation of the Notes, the editor has re-
sorted freely to such sources of 'information as were
within his reach ·‚ but he has endeavored to adapt his
instructions to the special needs of the student during
the more elementary stages of classical study. A learned
commentary would be manifestly out of place in a school
edition of Sallust.

The notes are not intended to interfere with that
course of direct personal instruction which belongs ex·-
clusively to the living teacher‚ but rather to prepare the
way for it. They aim to aid the student in surmount-
ing real and untried difficulties of construction and
idiom, and to furnish him such collater-al information as
will enable him to understand, appreciate, and enjoy his
lauthor. They are arranged topically in such a manner

- as to keep the general scope of thought as constantly as

possible before his mind.
