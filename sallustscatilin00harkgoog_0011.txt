OUTLINE OF THE LIFE OF SALLUST.

(ἔνυττε Smusrms ansrtm, the historian, was born 86
Β. 0., at Amiternum, in the country of the Sabines. Of his
early life little is known that is really worth recording. At
the age of 36, after having held in succession the offices of
quaestor and tribune of the people, he was expelled from
the Roman senate, either because of his profligate habits or
ln consequence of the political intrigues of the day. Three
years later, however, he succeeded in regaining his seat in
that body by an election to the praetorship. subsequently
his devotion to the cause of Caesar secured him the appoint-
ment of governor of Numidia, but his administration seems

to have been characterized by injustice and cruelty.

’ Returnin g to Rome with immense wealth, Sallust retired
to private life, and devoted himself to literary pursuits.
He purchased extensive grounds on the Quirinal Hill, and
laid them out in a most expensive and magnificent manner.
These groundS, afterward the favorite resort of Augustus
and his successore, are still known as the Gardens of Sallust.

Sallust died in the midst of his literary career at the
early age of 52. He was already the author of three his-
torical νοτὶς, the Conspiracy of Catiline, the J ugurthine
War, and a History of Rome from the death of Sulla to the
Mithridatio War. of the last, only a few fragments are
extant. The History of Catiline's Conspiracy is contained
in the present volume, and is commended to the learner as
,an interesting and important chapter in Roman history.
