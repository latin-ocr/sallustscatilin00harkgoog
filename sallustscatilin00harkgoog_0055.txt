INTROD UOTION.

L Sumtus (lu-mna, the conspirator, belonged to a patricisn
family which had become greatly impoverished. He was, there-
fore, the heir to a noble name, but to no large estates. Unprin·
cipled and reckless, he early perverted to the basest uses the
remarkable powers ot body and mind with which he had been
endowed by nature. As a zealous partisan of Sulla, he acted a

fortunately frustrated by a mistake on the part of Catilius, who
gave the signal before his accomplices were ready for action.

In June, 64 B. 0., Catilius resumed his revolutionary schemes
on a larger scale and with 'renewed enen-gy. Rome at that time
furnished him abundant materials for such a work in the througs
