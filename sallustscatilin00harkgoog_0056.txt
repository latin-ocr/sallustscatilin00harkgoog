venturers, who filled her streete. He soon numhered among his
accomplices eleven senators, tour member-s of the equestrian order,
and several men of position and influence in the provincial towns.
Thus strengthened, he boldly presented himself as a candidate for
the consulship, but defeat awaited him. Marcus Cicero the orator
and Gaius Antonius were elected consuls, the former by an over-
whelming majority.

This was a severe disappointment ior Oatiline‚ but it only
rendered him more reckless than ever in his revolutionary designs.
He had entered upon a desperate gamo, and he resolved to liazard
everyffiing, to win or (lie. He established the headquarters ot
his movement at Faesulae, in Etruria, under the command ot
Gaius Manlius, an insolvent and revolutionist, who had. served as
a centurion under Sulla. He raised money upon his own credit
and that of his friends, collected stores ot arms at convenient
centres in different portions οἱ Italy, and endeavored to enlist 'in
his cause the desperate and abandoned of both sexes and of all
ranks. His audacity aimed at nothing less than the overthrow ot
the government. He proposed ω seiae all the offices of trust and
emolument, to cancel debts‚ to confiscate the property of the rich,
and, in fine, to reenact the bloody scenes of Sulla's proscriptions.

It was at such a crisis that, on the first of January in that
memor-able year, 63 Β. 0., Gicero, the accomplished orator and
scholar, entered upon the arduous and perilous duties of the con·
sulship. A base and nefarious conspiracy against the government
was rapidly consummating its work, a bloody revolution was im·
minent, and even his own colleague in the consulship, Graius An-
tonius, was supposed to be more or less in sympathy with the
treasonable movement. But Oicero proved himself equal to the

. emergency. He secured the passive cooperation of Antonius by

offeritur, at the outnet, to transfer to him the rich province of
Macedonia at the expiration of his term of office. He, mox-cover,
opened communication with Quintus Curius, one os the accom-
plices ot Catilius, and, by means ot large promises, engaged him
to keep the government infor-med in regas-d to all the move-ments
of the conspirators. Curius proved a faithful and trustworthy
agent.

When the consular election for 62 B. Ο. approached‚ Catiline,
once more a candidate, determined not to suffer another defeat.
He accordingly adopted the bold project of murdering the pre-
siding consul, and, it need be, the rival candidates, and of carry-
