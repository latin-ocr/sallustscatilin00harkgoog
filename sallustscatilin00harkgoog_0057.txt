coNSPIRAOY OF camma

ing the election by force οἰ anns In view of these dangers, the
electiori was deferr-ed until the twenty-first ot October, and, aster-
ward, until the twenty-eighth. On the twenty-first of that mouth
the senate assembled to consider the state of the nation, and
at that session Cicero, in the presence of Catiline, exposed the
revolutionary designs of the conspirators, whereupon the senate
clothed the consuls with dictatorial powers for the safety ot the
republic. On the twenty-eighth, the comitia met according to
appointment3 Cicero appeared.in the Campus Martius, surronnded
by a strong body-guard ot armed men. The resolute bearing ot
the consul and his formidable guard so overawed the conspiratori!
that no disturbance was made. Catiline was again defeated3
Decimus Silanus and Lucius Murena were elected consuls for the
ensuing year.

In the mean time, civil war had already commenced; Manlius
was in arms against the republio. On the night ot the fifth oi
November, Catiline met the most prominent of his partisans at
the house of Marcus Laeca. He announced his purpose to jein
the army at the earliest possible date, assigned ω the leaders
their several parts in the work of the conspiracy, and urged upon
them the importance of taking the life of cicere. Two ot his
agents at once promised to eall upon the consul the next morning
and assassinate him in his own house; but Cicero, forewarned in
regar-d to their purpose, refused to admit them.

On the seventh of November, the senate met, for greater se-
curity, in the Temple of Jupiter Stator, which was guarded by
Roman knights. Catiline, contrary to the expectation of all, had
the effrontery to present himself at the meeting‚ but no greeting
welcomed him to his aecustomed place; the seats in his vicinity
were instantly vacated3 the traitor sat alone, an object of scorn
and contempt. It was then that Cicero, the consul, giving utter-

· ance to his indignation in a torrent of invective, pronounced his

Iv’irst Oration aqainst Catilina.

The effect was perfectly electrieal. Catiline was for the mo·
ment paralyzed, but, quickly recovering his self-possession and
assuming the tone of injured innocence, he implored the senate
not to trust the base slanders which the consul had heaped upon
him 3 he even ventured upon harsh and abusive langnage against
cicere, but his voice was at once drowned with eries of ‘⁶ Enemy 1 ’'
“ Traitorl '² from the whole assembly. That night he left the city.

On the following day, the eighth of November, Cicero deliv-
