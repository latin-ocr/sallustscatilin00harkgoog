INTRODUCTION.

cred his Second oration aqaimt Catilina before the people in the
Forum. His object was to justify the course which he had pur-
s'ued in relation to the conspiracy, to allay the general excitement,
and to intimidate the conspirators who had not yet left the city.

In the mean time, Oatiline had repaired to the camp os Man-
lius, and had assumed the fasces and other insignia of consular
power. The senate accordingly declared him an outlaw, ordered
new levies of troops, and dispatched able leaders to different
parts os the country where danger was apprehended. Cicero was
directed to guard the city, and Antonius was appointed to the
command of the army destined against Catiline.

According to the plan which Oatiline unfolded to his associ-
ates before his departure, Cethegus was to assassinate the consul
Oicer0,‘the praetor Lentulus was charged with the general man-
agement of the affairs of the conspiracy in the capital, Gabinius
and Statilius were to fire the city, and, in the midst of the general
confusion attendant upon the conflagration, the conspirators were
to open communication with Oatiline. But, while the execution
of the bloody plot was delayed, a deputation from the Allobroges -
in Gaul visited Rome, to present certain complaints against the
‘provincial government. Lentulus, taking advantage of their
disaffection, endeavored to interest them in the conspiracy, but
Oicero finally succeeded in secui-ing their cooperation, and, seeing
that they could be made very useful to the government, en-
couraged them to continue their negotiatione with the conspira-
tors, and obtain from them a written statement of the proposition
which they were to make to their people. The experiment was
periectly successful. The required statement, bearing the signa-
tures of Lentulus, Cethegus, and Statilius, was readily obtained.
The Gallio ambassadors, having finished their work, left Rome
on the night 01 the second of December, accompanied by Titus
Volturcius, the beai-er of dispatches tor Catilium but they had
proceeded only a short distance beyond the city gate when they
fell into the hands of an armed force in the employ ot the gov-
ernment. Lentulus, Cethegus, Statilius, and Gabinius, were ar-
rested the next morning. Later in the day, the prisoners were
all brought before the bar ot the senate, then assembled in the
Temple of Concord. The evidence of their guilt was overwhelm-
ing, and was finally confirmed by their own consessione.
